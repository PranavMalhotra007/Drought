        <h1 id="causes">Causes of Drought</h1>
		<p>Droughts can be triggered by natural causes such as weather patterns. But increasingly they are caused by human activity.

			<h4><br>Manmade causes include:</h4>
			
			<h4><br>Climate change –</h4> Climate change increases the odds of worsening drought in many parts of the United States and the world. Regions such as the U.S. Southwest, where droughts are expected to get more frequent, intense, and longer lasting, are at particular risk.

			How climate change contributes to drought:<br>
			
			<br>&#x2022;Warmer temperatures enhance evaporation, which reduces surface water and dries out soils and vegetation. This makes periods with low precipitation drier than they would be in cooler conditions.<br>
			<br>&#x2022;Climate change is also altering the timing of water availability.<br>
			<br>&#x2022;Warmer winter temperatures are causing less precipitation to fall as snow in the Northern Hemisphere, including in key regions like the Sierra Nevada of California.<br>
			<br>&#x2022;Decreased snowpack can be a problem, even if the total annual precipitation remains the same. This is because many water management systems rely on spring snowpack melt . Likewise, certain ecosystems also depend on snowmelt, which supplies cold water for species like salmon. Because snow acts as a reflective surface, decreasing snow area also increases surface temperatures, further exacerbating drought.<br>
			<br>&#x2022;Some climate models find that warming increases precipitation variability, meaning there will be more periods of both extreme precipitation and drought. This creates the need for expanded water storage during drought years and increased risk of flooding and dam failure during periods of extreme precipitation.<br>
			<br>&#x2022;Climate change is making certain regions drier<br>
			<br>&#x2022;For example, the Southwestern United States has already seen a decrease in annual precipitation since the beginning of the 20th century, and that trend is expected to continue.<br>
			<br>&#x2022;Estimates of future changes in seasonal or annual precipitation in a particular location are less certain than estimates of future warming, and are active areas of research. However, at the global scale, scientists are confident that relatively wet places, such as the tropics and higher latitudes, will get wetter, while relatively dry places in the subtropics (where most of the world’s deserts are located) will become drier.<br>
			<br>&#x2022;In some areas, droughts can persist through a vicious cycle, in which very dry soils and diminished plant cover absorb more solar radiation and heat up, encouraging the formation of high pressure systems that further suppress rainfall, leading an already dry area to become even drier.<br>
			<h4><br>Deforestation – </h4>
			<br>Is deforestation to blame for the areas around the world experiencing large-scale droughts? Scientists are starting to believe so. The negative effects of deforestation are well known: biodiversity is significantly impacted and a large amount of carbon is released into the atmosphere when trees are removed from their habitats. But what’s lesser known is its impact on the worsening droughts. Furthermore, some scientists postulate that we have cut so many forests that we might have reached a situation where severe drought is not only widespread but inevitable. What is the connection?<br>
		   
			<br>Unsurprisingly, the connections between forests and the climate are extremely complicated. Nevertheless, one simple fact is key: clouds require moisture. Forests, especially large expanses of rain forests, store moisture that, when it evaporates, aids in cloud formation. In forests, moisture collects on leaves, branches, and trunks. Forest soil retains moisture by its root systems, surface leaf litter, and prevents it from rapidly evaporating by the shade of the canopy (also, the temperatures are very low). Comparing habitats, a treeless savannah is hotter, and the soil stores far less water. Models showed a 30% reduction in evaporation from a savannah compared to a forest, with a corresponding reduction in rainfall.<br>

			  </div><br>
			  
			<br>The reduced water storage seems to manifest itself in longer dry spells, e.g. drought. The full-on wet season still occurs (climate, particularly monsoon climate, has a global component), but the evaporation from the forest feeds the smaller rains in between rainy seasons. Those other rains provide a substantial amount of rainfall, and prevent complete aridity in between monsoons.<br>
		   
			<br>So forests are not the only contributor to rain, but they can influence the amount and timing of downpours. Now enters climate change, which if the worst predictions come true may be sending the Amazon towards a tipping point where the rainforest, and its contributions to rain, will be replaced by hotter, drier savannah. All of the factors threatening the forest can feed on themselves—as the forest is cleared, the rain decreases at a faster rate, leading to longer droughts and higher temperatures. The longer droughts lead to longer and hotter fires, which clear more forest, thus speeding up the process. At the same time, clearing the forest increases the contribution of CO2 into the atmosphere, speeding up climate change and the deforestation-drought-fire feedback loop.<br>
		   
			<br>How will all this affect the world? Nobody can say for sure—yet. Droughts are already a problem in Brazil, but the complete loss of the Amazon is a worst-case scenario. Climates are linked globally, so loss of the Amazon forests could certainly affect agriculture here in the U.S. as well. plants and trees release water into the atmosphere, which creates clouds and then rain. Bad agricultural practices like intense farming not only contribute to deforestation in the first instance but also affect the absorbency of the soil, meaning it dries out much quicker.<br>
			<h4><br>High water demand – </h4>There are several reasons water demand might outweigh the supply, including intensive agriculture and population spikes. Also, high demand upstream in rivers (for dams or irrigation) can cause drought in lower, downstream areas. ERL graphic iopscience_header.jpg

			Over the past 50 years, human water use has more than doubled and affected streamflow over various regions of the world. However, it remains unclear to what degree human water consumption intensifies hydrological drought (the occurrence of anomalously low streamflow). Here, we quantify over the period 1960–2010 the impact of human water consumption on the intensity and frequency of hydrological drought worldwide. The results show that human water consumption substantially reduced local and downstream streamflow over Europe, North America and Asia, and subsequently
			 intensified the magnitude of hydrological droughts by 10–500%, occurring during nation- and continent-wide drought events. Also, human water consumption alone increased global drought frequency by 27 (±6)%. The intensification of drought frequency is most severe over Asia (35 ± 7%), but also substantial over North America (25 ± 6%) and Europe (20 ± 5%). Importantly, the severe drought conditions are driven primarily by human water consumption over many parts of these regions. Irrigation is responsible for the intensification of hydrological droughts over the western and central US, southern Europe and Asia, whereas the impact of industrial and households' consumption on the intensification is considerably larger over the eastern US and western and central Europe.
			  Our findings reveal that human water consumption is one of the more important mechanisms intensifying hydrological drought, and is likely to remain as a major factor affecting drought intensity and frequency in the coming decades.</p>
