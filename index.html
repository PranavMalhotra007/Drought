		<h1>What is Drought?</h1>
		<p>A drought is a prolonged period of abnormally low rainfall, leading to a shortage of water. It can have severe impacts on agriculture, ecosystems, and human health.
			Drought is a prolonged dry period in the natural climate cycle that can occur anywhere in the world. It is a slow-onset disaster characterized by the lack of precipitation, resulting in a water shortage. Drought can have a serious impact on health, agriculture, economies, energy and the environment.

An estimated 55 million people globally are affected by droughts every year, and they are the most serious hazard to livestock and crops in nearly every part of the world. Drought threatens people’s livelihoods, increases the risk of disease and death, and fuels mass migration. Water scarcity impacts 40% of the world’s population, and as many as 700 million people are at-risk of being displaced as a result of drought by 2030.

Rising temperatures caused by climate change are making already dry regions drier and wet regions wetter. In dry regions, this means that when temperatures rise, water evaporates more quickly, and thus increases the risk of drought or prolongs periods of drought. Between 80-90% of all documented disasters from natural hazards during the past 10 years have resulted from floods, droughts, tropical cyclones, heat waves and severe storms.

		  <h1>News of Drought all around the World</h1>
		  <p>
			<br>Over a billion people are desperate for a thin layer of soil and a few millimetres of rain to survive. These places do not have enough moisture to plant crops and quench thirsty fields. Drought is looming in every corner of the world, including the densely populated regions of India.

			<br>&#x2022;UP, Bihar, Jharkhand, and West Bengal — the major rice-producing states of India — are in the grips of drought in the absence of enough rain<br>
			<br>&#x2022;India has now entered the UN's Global Drought Vulnerability Index<br>
			<br>&#x2022;The US announced water cuts as rivers and lakes are hitting dangerous lows<br>
			<br>&#x2022;England had officially declared drought in many regions<br>
			<br>&#x2022;Companies have halted production in southwestern China after a drought caused hydropower shortages<br>
			<br>&#x2022;Somalia faces a famine after its worst drought in 40 years<br>
			<br>&#x2022;Chile started rationing water after its record-breaking 13th year of drought<br>
		  </p>
		  <h2>Why it matters?</h2>
		  <p>
			<br>About half of the planet's population (3.6 billion) lives in water-scarce regions. The consequent food and water crisis could be poised to drive up social unrest and massive migration. Such extended droughts also fuel the risk of wildfires.<br>


			<br><h3>How drought affects India</h3><br>
			<br>Many farmers in India's northeastern states are struggling. Some have lost entire rice crops. Others have delayed sowing. The precipitation of 2022’s monsoon has been poor so far in UP and Jharkhand. Uttar Pradesh received 44 per cent less rain than normal as of August 16. Bihar, Jharkhand, and West Bengal's situations also look grim, with an average of around 30 per cent less rainfall than usual.<br>

				  </div>
			<br>The latest government data shows that the sowing area of rice has declined in India by 12 per cent compared to last year. Jharkhand, West Bengal, Bihar, and Uttar Pradesh account for most of the reduction. The major causes of droughts in India are precipitation deficiency.<br>

				  </div>
			<br>India's drought-prone area has increased by 57 per cent since 1997. Drought has affected nearly two-thirds of the country from 2020 to 2022. Over the last decade, one-third of India's districts have experienced more than four droughts, and drought affects 50 million people each year.<br>
